Hello there! My name is Joshua Louderback and I'm currently working at Treyarch as a Senior Online Engineer. I've shipped _Call of Duty: Black Ops 4_,  _Call of Duty: Cold War_ and assisted on _Call of Duty: Vanguard_. I graduated May 2017 with a _Bachelors Of Science of Computer Science in Real Time Interactive Simulation_ from DigiPen Institute Of Technology. 

### My Passion ###

​I love video games and I love creating them. One of the most meaningful things to me, is being able to support the team in order to help elevate their work to the next level. When they can create something faster and/or better because of my contributions, I feel accomplished. This is why my passion falls into building tools and systems that help teammates achieve their goals. I believe great games come from what the designers, artist and musicians build and bring together. Being part of this cycle of helping them translate their ideas and creations into this digital world makes my job incredibly rewarding and fun.
