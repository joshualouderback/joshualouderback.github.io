* Graduating May 1st 2017!
* Developing a solo project in Unity utilizing AWS for player verification and progression storage for a FPS with RPG elements.
* Worked on a 3rd-person puzzle platformer in Unreal 4 for my final project as the Technical Director (Team of 12). 
* Spent the summer of 2016 interning at Treyarch Studios as a Networking Engineer.
* Worked on a HTC Vive VR project in Unity for my Junior year student project as the Technical Director (Team of 6).



### My Passion ###

â€‹I love video games and I love creating them. One of the most meaningful things to me, is being able to support the team in order to help elevate their work to the next level. When they can create something faster and/or better because of my contributions, I feel accomplished. This is why my passion falls into building tools and systems that help teammates achieve their goals. I believe great games come from what the designers, artist and musicians build and bring together. Being part of this cycle of helping them translate their ideas and creations into this digital world makes my job incredibly rewarding and fun.
