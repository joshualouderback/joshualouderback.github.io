>**_Hereafter_** is an HTC Vive game built in Unity, where you are for the first time truly thrown completely into a world. By being able to physically move around the space, our goal is to deliver a true personal experience. We hope to accomplish this by putting the player on a damaged spaceship, without any hope of returning home again.


**Role\: Technical Director**     
**Contributions:**

* Constructed and replaced Unity's event system with a faster and more robust event system that was similar to systems our designers are familiar with.
* Interfaced with Vive hardware, through their plugins, in order to design and create more friendly interfaces for our designers.
* Building and fine-tuning 3D interactions to deliver the realistic and intuitive personal engagements the Vive delivers to its users.
* An action system that allows designers to build complicated tasks, by breaking them down into simple actions that are managed for them.

>**_Polterheist_**, not only a play on words, but a play on fun!
A two player cooperative game, about sneaking through a ghost filled house to find a special trinket. Once you grab the trinket, the game turns itself on its head, by attracting ghosts even farther away to your attention! It turns into a tense game of keep away from the ghosts with your buddy, and once your done with that lame old trinket, throw it out the window and get to the next floor! 

**Role\: Tools Programmer**     
**Contributions:**

* Developed a tile based level editor, specifically for game designers in mind, where you can paint and delete tiles across the screen with a simple click and drag.
* Integrated AntTweakBar into the level editor, in order to manage all editor interactions.
* Implemented a robust GUI system that manged adding, interacting and removing layers through events.
* Supported creation of GUI elements within the editor, so you never had to touch menu code ever again!

### _There Can Only Be On Ninja_ (Ludum Dare 28) ###

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RRsR_DTW6JI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

>**_TCOBON_**, is a four player, local multiplayer versus game made during Ludum Dare 28 in 72 hours! This was actually only our second game we have ever made. The theme was "You can only get one". Inspired by that, we made a versus game where there was only one weapon, the shuriken! Player with the lowest score will start with the shuriken, or it will randomly select the from the lowest if there is a tie. Once the shuriken hits any walls it is safe to pick up, or if you want to try your luck you can try catching it. Note when the shuriken hits a player it stops and sits there, so when a player attempts to catch it they also create a smoke cloud. Anytime a player dies they create a smoke cloud, and this allows the players to fake dying and juke out unexpecting players if they successfully catch it! 

**Role\: Game Programmer**
**Contributions**

* Designed the concept, fleshed out the mechanics and came up with fake death!
* Implemented all gameplay mechanics and player controllers.
* Built the scoring system and score menus.
